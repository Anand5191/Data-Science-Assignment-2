        "By introducing a penalty on the size of coefficients, Lasso helps prevent overfitting—a common problem in complex models where they perform well on training data but poorly on\n",
        "unseen data. The regularization parameter (often denoted as lambda) controls the strength of this penalty; higher values lead to more shrinkage and fewer non-zero coefficients.\n",

        "4. Stability Selection\n",
        "Stability selection combines subsampling techniques with variable selection stability measures:\n",
        "Procedure: Multiple subsamples are drawn from data; Lasso models are fitted using various λ values.\n",
        "Outcome: Variables consistently selected across subsamples indicate robust choices for inclusion.\"\"\"\n"
