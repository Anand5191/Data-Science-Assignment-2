        "Precision and recall are fundamental metrics used to evaluate the performance of classification models, particularly in the context of binary classification tasks. These metrics\n",

        "\n",
        "Precision\n",
        "Precision, also known as positive predictive value, is a measure that indicates the proportion of true positive results in relation to all positive predictions made by the model.\n",
        "In simpler terms, precision answers the question: \"Of all instances that were predicted as positive, how many were actually positive?\" It is calculated using the formula:\n",

        "Precision=True Positives (TP) / True Positives (TP)+False Positives (FP)\n",
        "A high precision score indicates that when the model predicts a positive class, it is likely correct. This metric is particularly important in scenarios where false positives carry\n",

        "Trade-off Between Precision and Recall\n",
        "There is often a trade-off between precision and recall; improving one can lead to a decrease in the other. This trade-off arises because increasing precision typically involves\n",
        "being more conservative with predictions (thus reducing false positives), which may result in missing some true positives and lowering recall. Conversely, increasing recall might\n",
        "involve predicting more instances as positive to capture all true positives but at the risk of increasing false positives and reducing precision.\n",

        "F1 Score=2×(Precision×Recall / Precision+Recall)\n",
