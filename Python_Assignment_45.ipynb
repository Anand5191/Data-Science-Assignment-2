For linear regression to produce reliable and valid results, certain assumptions must be met. Below, we will discuss these assumptions in detail and explain how they can be checked in a given dataset.\n",

        "1. Linearity\n",
        "Assumption:\n",
        "The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is linear. This means that changes in the predictors are proportional to changes in the response variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "How to Check:\n",
        "Scatterplots: Plot each independent variable against the dependent variable. If the relationship appears linear (i.e., forms a straight-line pattern), this assumption holds.\n",
        "Residual Plots: After fitting the model, plot residuals (errors) against predicted values. If there is no discernible pattern (e.g., no curves or systematic structure), linearity is satisfied.\n",
        "Correlation Coefficient: For simple linear regression, calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between each predictor and the response variable. A high absolute value indicates a strong linear relationship.\n",
