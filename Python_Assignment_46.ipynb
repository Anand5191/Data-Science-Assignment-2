        "\n",
        "Understanding RMSE and MAE\n",
        "Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)\n",
        "RMSE is a widely used metric for evaluating the accuracy of a regression model. It measures the square root of the average squared differences between predicted values and actual\n",
        "values.\n",
        "Characteristics:\n",
        "Sensitivity to Outliers: RMSE gives higher weight to larger errors due to squaring each error term before averaging. This makes it particularly sensitive to outliers.\n",
        "Interpretability: RMSE has the same units as the dependent variable, making it interpretable in terms of those units.\n",
        "Usefulness: It is often preferred when large errors are particularly undesirable\n",
        "\n",
        "Mean Absolute Error (MAE)\n",
        "MAE measures the average magnitude of errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Characteristics:\n",
        "Robustness to Outliers: Unlike RMSE, MAE does not square error terms; therefore, it is less sensitive to outliers.\n",
        "Interpretability: Like RMSE, MAE also has the same units as the dependent variable.\n",
        "Simplicity: It provides a straightforward measure of average error magnitude.\n",
        "\n",
        "Choosing Between Model A and Model B\n",
        "To decide which model performs better based on these metrics alone can be challenging because they measure different aspects of prediction error:\n",
        "\n",
        "Model A's RMSE (10): Indicates that on average, squared prediction errors are larger compared to Model B's absolute errors. If minimizing large errors or dealing with datasets\n",
        "where outliers are significant concerns, this model might be less favorable unless those large errors are acceptable within context.\n",
        "Model B's MAE (8): Suggests that on average, prediction errors are smaller in absolute terms than Model A’s squared errors suggest. This could indicate better performance if\n",
        "consistent accuracy across all predictions is more critical than penalizing larger deviations heavily.\n",
        "Limitations in Metric Choice\n",
        "The choice between these metrics depends on several factors:\n",
        "\n",
        "Nature of Data: If data contains significant outliers or skewed distributions, RMSE might exaggerate their impact more than MAE would.\n",
        "\n",
        "Objective Priorities: If reducing large deviations from true values is crucial (e.g., financial forecasting), then RMSE might be more appropriate despite its sensitivity to\n",
        "outliers.\n",
        "\n",
