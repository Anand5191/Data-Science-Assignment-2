        "within that dataset. These measures help describe the overall distribution and provide insights into where most data points cluster. There are three primary measures of\n",
        "central tendency, each with its own method of calculation and application.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Mean\n",
        "The mean is commonly referred to as the “average.” It is calculated by summing all the values in a dataset and dividing by the total number of values.\n",
        "The formula for the mean is: (mean) = (Σx) / n\n",

        "Where:\n",

        "Σx represents the sum of all data points.\n",
        "n is the total number of data points.\n",
        "The mean is sensitive to extreme values (outliers), which can skew its value significantly in datasets with large variations.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Median\n",
        "The median is the middle value in an ordered dataset (i.e., sorted from smallest to largest). If there is an odd number of observations, the median is the single middle value.\n",
        " If there is an even number, it is calculated as the average of the two middle values.\n",
        "\n",
        "The median provides a better measure of central tendency than the mean when dealing with skewed distributions or datasets with outliers because it focuses on positional value\n",

        "\n",
        "3. Mode\n",
        "The mode represents the most frequently occurring value(s) in a dataset. A dataset may have one mode (unimodal), more than one mode (bimodal or multimodal), or no mode at all\n",

        "Applicability: The mean is appropriate for interval and ratio data but not for ordinal or nominal data.\n",

        "Characteristics of Median\n",

        "Covariance\n",
        "Definition\n",
        "Covariance is a measure of how much two random variables change together. It indicates the direction of the linear relationship between the variables. If both variables tend\n",
        "to increase or decrease together, the covariance is positive; if one variable increases while the other decreases, the covariance is negative.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interpretation\n",
        "Covariance values can range from negative infinity to positive infinity. A positive covariance indicates that as one variable increases, so does the other, while a negative value indicates an inverse relationship. However, because covariance is not standardized, its magnitude can be difficult to interpret without context regarding the units of measurement.\n",
        "\n",
        "Correlation\n",
        "Definition\n",

        "Interpretation\n",
        "Correlation values range from -1 to +1. A value of +1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, and 0 indicates no linear relationship at all. This standardization makes correlation more interpretable than covariance.\n",

        "Both covariance and correlation are widely used in statistical analysis for various purposes:\n",

        "Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Both metrics help reduce dimensionality in datasets by identifying principal components based on variance (covariance matrix) or standardized relationships (correlation matrix).\n",

        "Portfolio Management: In finance, covariance helps assess how different assets move together to optimize investment portfolios.\n",
