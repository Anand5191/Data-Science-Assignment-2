        "\n",
        "1. Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization):\n",
        "Lasso regression is a linear regression technique that applies L1 regularization, which penalizes the absolute size of the coefficients. This method encourages sparsity in the\n",
        "model by forcing some coefficients to be exactly zero, effectively selecting a subset of features that contribute most significantly to the prediction. The ability to set\n",
        "coefficients to zero allows for automatic feature selection during model training.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization):\n",
        "While primarily known for its ability to handle multicollinearity by shrinking coefficients, ridge regression can also be utilized for feature selection when combined with other\n",
        "techniques. Although it does not inherently set coefficients to zero like Lasso, it helps identify important features by reducing the impact of less significant ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Decision Trees:\n",
        "Decision tree algorithms inherently perform feature selection as part of their structure. At each node, a decision tree selects the best feature based on criteria such as Gini\n",

        "Filter methods are widely used in feature selection due to their simplicity and computational efficiency. However, they come with several drawbacks that can impact the\n",
        "performance of machine learning models. Below are some of the primary limitations associated with filter methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Ignoring Feature Interactions:\n",
        "Filter methods typically evaluate features independently, which means they do not account for interactions between features. This can lead to the omission of important\n",
        "combinations of features that may be relevant only when considered together. As a result, significant predictive power may be lost.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Lack of Classifier Dependency:\n",
        "Since filter methods operate independently from any specific classifier, they do not optimize for the particular characteristics or biases of the chosen model. This can lead to\n",
        "suboptimal feature sets that do not perform well when applied to a specific classification algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Potential for Redundant Features:\n",
        "Filter methods often fail to eliminate redundant features effectively. When multiple features provide similar information, retaining all of them can clutter the model and increase\n",
        "computational complexity without adding significant value.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Limited Scope of Evaluation Metrics:\n",
        "Many filter methods rely on univariate statistics (e.g., correlation coefficients, chi-square tests) as evaluation metrics. These metrics may not capture complex relationships or\n",

        "\n",
        "5. Risk of Overfitting:\n",

Common metrics for regression tasks include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), \\nor R-squared values.\\n\\nGenerate Feature Subsets: Create various combinations of features from your dataset. This can be done through:\\n\\nForward Selection: Start with no features and add one feature at a time based on performance improvement.\\nBackward Elimination: Start with all features and remove one feature at a time based on performance degradation.\\nExhaustive Search: Evaluate all possible combinations of features (feasible only for small datasets).\\nEvaluate Each Subset: For each subset generated, train your chosen model and evaluate its performance using the defined metric.\\n\\nSelect the Best Subset: Identify which subset yielded the best performance according to your evaluation metric.\\n\\nCross-Validation: To ensure that your selected features generalize well to unseen data, use cross-validation techniques during evaluation.\\n\\nExample Application\\nSuppose you are tasked with predicting house prices based on three main features: size (in square feet), location (categorical variable encoded as numerical values), and age \\n(in years). You would follow these steps:\\n\\nDefine your predictive model; for instance, you might choose linear regression.\\nDecide that you will use R-squared as your evaluation metric.\\nGenerate subsets of these three features:\\nStart with just “size.”\\nAdd “location” and evaluate.\\nFinally, add “age” and evaluate again.\\nAfter evaluating these combinations through multiple iterations and possibly employing cross-validation, you would identify which combination yields the highest R-squared value.\\n\\nAdvantages and Disadvantages\\nAdvantages\\nThe wrapper method considers feature interactions, potentially leading to better-performing models.\\nIt can adapt to any type of predictive model being used.\\nDisadvantages\\nComputationally intensive; may not be feasible with large datasets or many features due to combinatorial explosion.\\nProne to overfitting if not properly validated.'"
