        "Advantages\n",
        "Ridge regression can handle multicollinearity effectively by penalizing large coefficients.\n",
        "It provides more stable estimates than OLS when predictors are highly correlated.\n",
        "By including lagged terms, it can capture temporal dependencies inherent in time-series data.\n",
        "Limitations\n",
        "Selecting an appropriate λ requires careful tuning through cross-validation.\n",
        "Ridge regression assumes linear relationships; hence it may not capture complex nonlinear patterns without additional transformations or feature engineering.\n",
        "It does not inherently address autocorrelation; additional steps must be taken to ensure residual independence.\"\"\"\n"
